            I am a creative front-end developer who has a strong affinity for animation, 
            art, and design. With a background in film, I bring a unique perspective to my work, 
            striving to create visually eye-grabbing, fun, and impactful experiences. My goal is to 
            craft interfaces that not only look great but also provide seamless functionality, leaving 
            a lasting impact on users.
